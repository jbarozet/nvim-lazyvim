# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

My nvim config based on [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

## Backup your existing installation

Make a backup of your current Neovim files:

Required

```shell
mv ~/.config/nvim{,.bak}
```

Optional but recommended

```shell
mv ~/.local/share/nvim{,.bak}
mv ~/.local/state/nvim{,.bak}
mv ~/.cache/nvim{,.bak}
```

## Clone the starter

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jbarozet/nvim-lazyvim ~/.config/nvim
```

## Start Neovim

```shell
nvim
```
